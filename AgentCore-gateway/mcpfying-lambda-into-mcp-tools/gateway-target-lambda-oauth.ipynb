        "2. ✅ **Register Lambda functions** as MCP tools with custom schemas\n",
        "3. ✅ **Connect Strands Agents** to discover and use Lambda-backed tools\n",

        "\n",
        "- **AgentCore Gateway** bridges AWS Lambda functions and AI agents via MCP protocol\n",
        "- **EZAuth flow** simplifies Cognito setup for OAuth authentication\n",
        "- **Multiple targets** can be registered, each exposing different Lambda functions\n",
        "- **Tool schemas** define how Lambda functions are exposed to agents\n",
        "- **MCP client** must remain active while agents are using tools\n",
        "\n",
        "## Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "- Register your own Lambda functions with custom tool schemas\n",
        "- Explore S3-based tool schemas for larger configurations\n",
        "- Integrate with other AI agent frameworks that support MCP\n",
        "- Set up monitoring and logging for production deployments\n",
